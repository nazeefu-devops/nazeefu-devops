## 💫 About Me

I’m a DevOps Engineer with hands-on experience designing AWS cloud infrastructure, building production-grade CI/CD pipelines, and deploying containerized applications at scale. I focus on automation, reliability, and repeatable infrastructure — reducing manual work and deployment risk.

- 🔭 Currently working on **CI/CD automation using Jenkins & GitHub Actions** and **containerized deployments on AWS**
- 👯 Open to collaborating on **DevOps, Cloud Infrastructure, CI/CD, and Kubernetes projects**
- 🤝 Looking to grow deeper in **Kubernetes (EKS), observability, and cloud cost optimization**
- 🌱 Learning **advanced Terraform patterns, Kubernetes internals, and scalable system design**
- 💬 Ask me about **AWS VPCs, CI/CD pipelines, Docker, Jenkins, Terraform, and DevOps workflows**
- ⚡ Fun fact: I transitioned from **Android development to DevOps**, so I understand both application code and infrastructure
